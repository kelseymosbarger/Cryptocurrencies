# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18

# Overview

The purpose of this project is to use an unsupervised machine learning model to analyze and visualize actively trading cyrptocurrencies. 

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

# Results
There are 532 actively trading cryptocurrencies that the model cleaned and processed.



### Elbow Curve
The model identifies values to create an elbow curve using K-Means clutering to find the best value for K.



### 3-D Scatter plot
3D scatter plot is created using the PCA algorithm minimize and cluster the relationships and dimensions to create 3 principal components.



### 2-D Scatter Plot
The final visual plots the cryptocurriences on a trditional 2-D plot Total Coin Supply vs Total Coins Mined
